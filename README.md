# sistema-bancario-v3
 
In this project, I evolved the idea of a mini banking system, using object-oriented programming knowledge. The banking system includes functions to register clients, create accounts, perform login and logout operations, handle withdrawals, deposits, and provide account statements. As a future enhancement, my plan is to model and create a database to enable data persistence.

With a focus on project security, even though it is a simple project, I utilized the BCRYPT library to encrypt the input of user passwords using the hashpw() function.
